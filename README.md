Project to create a Library (from The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum)

**About the project:** This project aims to create a Library to create and store digital books by using an object-based architecture. The task itself can be found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library.

**Built with:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Accomplishments**:
- Learned about the importance of minimizing global variables. Instead, I tried to keep features as isolated and encapsulated as possible inside factory functions and modules.
- Learned about and was able to apply succesfully destructuring, in order to export variables or functions from closures and use them elsewhere.
- Understood more deeply the power of objects and why they are the base of JavaScript.
- Found a big blocker with an event listener which was adding up and firing multiple times. This lead me to refactor the initial code, making it more encapsulated and clean, which lead me to catch the bug, which lead me to find andlearn about the "once" parameter in addEventListener, which solved the problem.
- Learned and applied the checkValidity() method to validate forms easily through JavaScript.
- Understood more deeply and applied successfully the "e" parameter when using addEventListeners.
